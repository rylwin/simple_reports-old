SimpleReports
=============

SimpleReports was designed to give developers complete control over the generation of their reports
while maintaining a simple interface that allows for rapid development. 

SimpleReports supports output in four formats: HTML, XLS, PDF (Prawn), PDF (Latex, experimental), TXT.
Map support (i.e., Google Maps API) is built in for HTML and PDF modes.

SimpleReports is still very young, and any help as far as development or ideas are more than welcome.

TODO
=======

-Caching
-- Invalidation of cached rows
-- More complex rules for when to cache
-- Row, cell formats need to be saved, too
-Charts
-More testing
